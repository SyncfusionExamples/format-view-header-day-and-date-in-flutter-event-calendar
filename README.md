# How to format the view header day and date in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to format the view header day and date in the Flutter Calendar.

Using the [dayFormat](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/TimeSlotViewSettings/dayFormat.html) and [dateFormat](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/TimeSlotViewSettings/dateFormat.html) properties in TimeSlotViewSettings, you can format the view header date and day in the Flutter Event Calendar. In this example, the day format and dateFormat are set based on the current calendar view by using the onViewChanged callback in the calendar.
